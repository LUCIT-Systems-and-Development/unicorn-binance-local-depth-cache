## Get a UNICORN Binance Suite License

To run modules of the *UNICORN Binance Suite* you need a [valid license](https://medium.lucit.tech/how-to-obtain-and-use-a-unicorn-binance-suite-license-key-and-run-the-ubs-module-according-to-best-87b0088124a8#4ca4)!

## Using a DepthCache

### [Create a local depth_cache](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=create_depth_cache#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.create_depth_cache) for Binance with just 3 lines of code
```
from unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache import BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager, DepthCacheOutOfSync

ubldc = BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager(exchange="binance.com", depth_cache_update_interval=100)
ubldc.create_depth_cache("BTCUSDT")
```

### Get the [asks](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=get_asks#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.get_asks) and [bids](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=get_bids#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.get_bids)
#### To obtain the complete order book
```
asks = ubldc.get_asks("BTCUSDT")
bids = ubldc.get_bids("BTCUSDT")
```

#### Get the first X elements
```
asks = ubldc.get_asks("BTCUSDT", limit_count=10)
bids = ubldc.get_bids("BTCUSDT", limit_count=10)
```

#### Retain the elements until volume X has been exceeded
```
asks = ubldc.get_asks("BTCUSDT", threshold_volume=300000)
bids = ubldc.get_bids("BTCUSDT", threshold_volume=300000)
```

### Catch an exception, if the [depth_cache is out of sync](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.exceptions.DepthCacheOutOfSync) while accessing its data
```
try:
    asks = ubldc.get_asks(market="BTCUSDT", limit_count=5, threshold_volume=300000)
    bids = ubldc.get_bids(market="BTCUSDT", limit_count=5, threshold_volume=300000)
except DepthCacheOutOfSync:
    asks = "Out of sync!"
    bids = "Out of sync!"
```

### [Stop and delete a depth_cache](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=stop_depth_cache#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.stop_depth_cache):
```
ubldc.stop_depth_cache("BTCUSDT")
```

## Stop `ubldc` after usage to avoid memory leaks

When you instantiate UBLDC with `with`, `ubldc.stop_manager()` is automatically executed upon exiting the `with`-block.

```
with BinanceWebSocketApiManager() as ubldc:
    ubldc.create_depth_cache("BTCUSDT")
```

Without `with`, you must explicitly execute `ubldc.stop_manager()` yourself.

```
ubldc.stop_manager()
```

## Description
The Python package [UNICORN Binance Local Depth Cache](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.html) 
provides local order books for the Binance Exchanges 
[Binance](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs) ([+Testnet](https://testnet.binance.vision/)), 
[Binance Futures](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/futures/en/#websocket-market-streams) 
([+Testnet](https://testnet.binancefuture.com)) and [Binance US](https://www.binance.us/).

The algorithm of the depth_cache management was designed according to these instructions:

- [Binance Spot: "How to manage a local order book correctly"](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#how-to-manage-a-local-order-book-correctly)
- [Binance Futures: "How to manage a local order book correctly"](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/futures/en/#diff-book-depth-streams)
- [Binance US: "Managing a Local Order Book"](https://docs.binance.us/#order-book-depth-diff-stream)

With [Create_depth_cache()`](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=create_depth_cache#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.create_depth_caches) 
the depth_cache is started and initialized, i.e. for each depth_cache that is to be created, a separate 
asyncio coroutine is inserted into the event loop of the stream. As soon as at least one depth update is received via 
websocket is received, a REST snapshot is downloaded and the depth updates are applied to it so that it is synchronized 
in real time. As soon as Once this is done, the status of the cache is set to "synchronous".

Data in the depth_cache can be accessed with ['get_asks()'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=get_asks#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.get_asks) 
and ['get_bids()'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=get_bids#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.get_bids). 
If the state of the depth_cache is not synchronous during access, the exception 
['DepthCacheOutOfSync'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.exceptions.DepthCacheOutOfSync) 
is thrown.

The depth_cache will immediately start an automatic re-initialization if a gap in the UpdateID`s is detected (missing 
update event) or if the websocket connection is interrupted. As soon as this happens the state of the depth_cache is set 
to "out of sync" and when accessing the cache the exception ['DepthCacheOutOfSync'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.exceptions.DepthCacheOutOfSync) is thrown.

### Why a local depth_cache?
A local depth_cache is the fastest way to access the current order book depth at any time while transferring as little data as necessary. A REST snapshot takes a lot of time and the amount of data that is transferred is relatively large. Continuous full transmission of the order book via websocket is faster, but the amount of data is huge. A local depth_cache is initialized once with a REST snapshot and then handles Diff. Depth updates applied by the websocket connection. By transferring a small amount of data (only the changes), a local depth_cache is kept in sync in real time and also allows extremely fast (local) access to the data without exceeding the [Binance request weight limits](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360004492232).

### What are the benefits of the UNICORN Binance Local Depth Cache?
- Always know if the cache is in sync! If the depth_cache is out of sync, the exception ['DepthCacheOutOfSync'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.exceptions.DepthCacheOutOfSync) 
is thrown or ask with [`is_depth_cache_synchronized()`](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.is_depth_cache_synchronized). 

- If a depth cache is out of sync it gets refreshed automatically within a few seconds.

- 100% Websocket auto-reconnect!

(Refresh update once a minute!)

## Installation and Upgrade
The module requires Python 3.7 and runs smoothly up to and including Python 3.12.

For the PyPy interpreter we offer packages only from Python version 3.9 and higher.

Anaconda packages are available from Python version 3.8 and higher, but only in the latest version!

The current dependencies are listed [here](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache/blob/master/requirements.txt).

If you run into errors during the installation take a look [here](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-suite/wiki/Installation).

### Packages are created automatically with GitHub Actions
When a new release is to be created, we start two GitHubActions: 

- [Build and Publish Anaconda](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache/actions/workflows/build_conda.yml)
- [Build and Publish GH+PyPi](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache/actions/workflows/build_wheels.yml) 

Both start virtual Windows/Linux/Mac servers provided by GitHub in the cloud with preconfigured environments and 
create the respective compilations and stub files, pack them into wheels and conda packages and then publish them on 
GitHub, PYPI and Anaconda. This is a transparent method that makes it possible to trace the source code behind a 
compilation.

### A Cython binary, PyPy or source code based CPython wheel of the latest version with `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/unicorn-binance-rest-api/)
Our [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) Wheels are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), 
these wheels offer significant advantages for Python developers:

- ***Performance Boost with Cython Wheels:*** Cython is a programming language that supplements Python with static typing and C-level performance. By compiling 
  Python code into C, Cython Wheels can significantly enhance the execution speed of Python code, especially in 
  computationally intensive tasks. This means faster runtimes and more efficient processing for users of our package. 

- ***PyPy Wheels for Enhanced Efficiency:*** PyPy is an alternative Python interpreter known for its speed and efficiency. It uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, 
  which can dramatically improve the performance of Python code. Our PyPy Wheels are tailored for compatibility with 
  PyPy, allowing users to leverage this speed advantage seamlessly.

Both Cython and PyPy Wheels on PyPI make the installation process simpler and more straightforward. They ensure that 
you get the optimized version of our package with minimal setup, allowing you to focus on development rather than 
configuration.
