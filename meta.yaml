    A Python SDK by [LUCIT](https://www.lucit.tech) to access and manage multiple local Binance DepthCaches with Python 
    in a simple, fast, flexible, robust and fully-featured way. 
    
    The organization of the DepthCache takes place in the same asyncio loop as the reception of the websocket data. The 
    full stack of the UBS modules (REST, WebSocket and DepthCache) can be downloaded and installed by PyPi and Anaconda 
    as a Python C extension for maximum performance.
    
    Part of '[UNICORN Binance Suite](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-suite.html)'.

    [`UNICORN Binance Suite Assistant` GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-VjCOjRhCJ-unicorn-binance-suite-assistant) or 
    [a real human LUCIT employee](https://www.lucit.tech/get-support.html).
    
    ## Get a UNICORN Binance Suite License
    
    To run modules of the *UNICORN Binance Suite* you need a [valid license](https://medium.lucit.tech/how-to-obtain-and-use-a-unicorn-binance-suite-license-key-and-run-the-ubs-module-according-to-best-87b0088124a8#4ca4)!
    
    ## Using a DepthCache
    
    ### [Create a local depth_cache](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=create_depth_cache#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.create_depth_cache) for Binance with just 3 lines of code:
    ```
    from unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache import BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager, DepthCacheOutOfSync
    
    ubldc = BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager(exchange="binance.com")
    ubldc.create_depth_cache("BTCUSDT")
    ```
    
    ### Get the [asks](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=get_asks#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.get_asks) and [bids](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=get_bids#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.get_bids) depth with:
    ```
    asks = ubldc.get_asks("BTCUSDT")
    bids = ubldc.get_bids("BTCUSDT")
    ```
    
    ### Catch an exception, if the [depth_cache is out of sync](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.exceptions.DepthCacheOutOfSync) while accessing its data:
    ```
    try:
        print(f"Top 10 asks: {ubldc.get_asks(market=market)[:10]}")
        print(f"Top 10 bids: {ubldc.get_bids(market=market)[:10]}")
    except DepthCacheOutOfSync as error_msg:
        print(f"ERROR: {error_msg}")
    ```
    
    ### [Stop and delete a depth_cache](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=stop_depth_cache#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.stop_depth_cache):
    ```
    ubldc.stop_depth_cache("BTCUSDT")
    ```
    
    ## Stop `ubldc` after usage to avoid memory leaks
    
    When you instantiate UBLDC with `with`, `ubldc.stop_manager()` is automatically executed upon exiting the `with`-block.
    
    ```
    with BinanceWebSocketApiManager() as ubldc:
        ubldc.create_depth_cache("BTCUSDT")
    ```
    
    Without `with`, you must explicitly execute `ubldc.stop_manager()` yourself.
    
    ```
    ubldc.stop_manager()
    ```

    ## Description
    The Python package [UNICORN Binance Local Depth Cache](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.html) 
    provides a local depth_cache for the Binance Exchanges [Binance](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs) 
    ([+Testnet](https://testnet.binance.vision/)), 
    [Binance Futures](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/futures/en/#websocket-market-streams) 
    ([+Testnet](https://testnet.binancefuture.com)) - more are coming soon.
    
    The algorithm of the depth_cache management was designed according to these instructions:
    
    - [Binance Spot: "How to manage a local order book correctly"](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#how-to-manage-a-local-order-book-correctly)
    - [Binance Futures: "How to manage a local order book correctly"](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/futures/en/#diff-book-depth-streams)
    
    By [`create_depth_cache()`](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=create_depth_cache#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.create_depth_caches) 
    the depth_cache is started and initialized, that means for each depth_cache you want to create a separate 
    thread is started. As soon as at least one depth update is received via websocket, a REST snapshot is downloaded and 
    the depth updates are applied to it, keeping it in sync in real-time. Once this is done, the state of the cache is set 
    to "synchronous".
    
    Data in the depth_cache can be accessed with ['get_asks()'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=get_asks#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.get_asks) 
    and ['get_bids()'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=get_bids#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.get_bids). 
    If the state of the depth_cache is not synchronous during access, the exception 
    ['DepthCacheOutOfSync'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.exceptions.DepthCacheOutOfSync) 
    is thrown.
    
    The depth_cache will immediately start an automatic re-initialization if a gap in the UpdateID`s is detected (missing 
    update event) or if the websocket connection is interrupted. As soon as this happens the state of the depth_cache is set 
    to "out of sync" and when accessing the cache the exception ['DepthCacheOutOfSync'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.exceptions.DepthCacheOutOfSync) is thrown.
    
    ### Why a local depth_cache?
    A local depth_cache is the fastest way to access the current order book depth at any time while transferring as little data as necessary. A REST snapshot takes a lot of time and the amount of data that is transferred is relatively large. Continuous full transmission of the order book via websocket is faster, but the amount of data is huge. A local depth_cache is initialized once with a REST snapshot and then handles Diff. Depth updates applied by the websocket connection. By transferring a small amount of data (only the changes), a local depth_cache is kept in sync in real time and also allows extremely fast (local) access to the data without exceeding the [Binance request weight limits](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360004492232).
    
    ### What are the benefits of the UNICORN Binance Local Depth Cache?
    - Always know if the cache is in sync! If the depth_cache is out of sync, the exception ['DepthCacheOutOfSync'](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.exceptions.DepthCacheOutOfSync) 
    is thrown or ask with [`is_depth_cache_synchronized()`](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=is_depth_cache_synchronized#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.is_depth_cache_synchronized). 
    - If a depth cache is out of sync it gets refreshed automatically within a few seconds.
    - 100% Websocket auto-reconnect!

    - Create multiple depth caches within a single object instance. 
    - Each depth_cache is processed in a separate thread.
    - Start or stop multiple caches with just one command 
    [`create_depth_cache()`](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html?highlight=create_depth_cache#unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.manager.BinanceLocalDepthCacheManager.create_depth_caches)

    [GitHub](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache)! 
    
    ## Installation and Upgrade
    The module requires Python 3.7 or above, as it depends on Pythons latest asyncio features for asynchronous/concurrent 
    processing. 
    
    For the PyPy interpreter we offer packages only from Python version 3.9 and higher.
    
    Anaconda packages are available from Python version 3.8 and higher.
    
    The current dependencies are listed [here](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache/blob/master/requirements.txt).
    
    If you run into errors during the installation take a look [here](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-suite/wiki/Installation).
    
    ### Packages are created automatically with GitHub Actions
    When a new release is to be created, we start two GitHubActions: 
    
    - [Build and Publish Anaconda](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache/actions/workflows/build_conda.yml)
    - [Build and Publish GH+PyPi](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache/actions/workflows/build_wheels.yml) 
    
    Both start virtual Windows/Linux/Mac servers provided by GitHub in the cloud with preconfigured environments and 
    create the respective compilations and stub files, pack them into wheels and conda packages and then publish them on 
    GitHub, PYPI and Anaconda. This is a transparent method that makes it possible to trace the source code behind a 
    compilation.
    
    ### A Cython binary, PyPy or source code based CPython wheel of the latest version with `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/unicorn-binance-rest-api/)
    Our [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) Wheels are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), 
    these wheels offer significant advantages for Python developers:
    
    - ***Performance Boost with Cython Wheels:*** Cython is a programming language that supplements Python with static typing and C-level performance. By compiling 
      Python code into C, Cython Wheels can significantly enhance the execution speed of Python code, especially in 
      computationally intensive tasks. This means faster runtimes and more efficient processing for users of our package. 
    
    - ***PyPy Wheels for Enhanced Efficiency:*** PyPy is an alternative Python interpreter known for its speed and efficiency. It uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, 
      which can dramatically improve the performance of Python code. Our PyPy Wheels are tailored for compatibility with 
      PyPy, allowing users to leverage this speed advantage seamlessly.
    
    Both Cython and PyPy Wheels on PyPI make the installation process simpler and more straightforward. They ensure that 
    you get the optimized version of our package with minimal setup, allowing you to focus on development rather than 
    configuration.
